# When Should I Use builderman?

<div className="bg-green-900/20 border border-green-800 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
  <h2 className="mt-0 mb-4">
    builderman is a good fit when:
  </h2>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-neutral-300 mb-0 pl-0">
    <li>You have interdependent tasks that must run in a well-defined order</li>
    <li>You run long-lived processes that need readiness detection (not just exit codes)</li>
    <li>Cleanup and teardown matter (containers, databases, servers, watchers)</li>
    <li>You want deterministic execution with structured results instead of log-scraping</li>
    <li>You need observable pipelines that behave the same locally and in CI</li>
    <li>You want to compose and reuse workflows, not just run scripts</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div className="bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-800 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
  <h2 className="mt-0 mb-4">It may be overkill if:</h2>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-neutral-300 mb-0 pl-0">
    <li>Your workflow is a handful of linear npm scripts</li>
    <li>Tasks are fire-and-forget and don't require cleanup</li>
    <li>You don't need dependency graphs, cancellation, or failure propagation</li>
  </ul>
</div>

## Use Cases

### Monorepos

builderman excels in monorepo environments where you need to:

- Build packages in the correct dependency order
- Cache builds based on inputs and artifacts
- Compose complex build pipelines
- Run tests after builds complete

### Development Workflows

For development, builderman helps with:

- Starting databases, servers, and watchers in the right order
- Waiting for services to be ready before starting dependents
- Ensuring proper cleanup when stopping development servers
- Handling cancellation gracefully (e.g., Ctrl+C)

### CI/CD Pipelines

In CI/CD, builderman provides:

- Structured error reporting (no log-scraping needed)
- Execution statistics for monitoring and debugging
- Deterministic execution that works the same locally and in CI
- Concurrency control to manage resource usage
- Strict mode to catch missing commands early

### Complex Orchestration

When you need to orchestrate complex workflows:

- Compose pipelines from smaller pipelines
- Handle conditional dependencies
- Manage long-running processes with readiness detection
- Ensure cleanup happens even on failure

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs. npm scripts

builderman provides explicit dependency graphs, structured results, cancellation, and teardown. npm scripts are simpler but don't handle complex dependencies or cleanup.

### vs. Task runners (Gulp, Grunt)

builderman focuses on process execution and orchestration rather than file transformations. It's better suited for running external commands, managing dependencies, and handling long-running processes.

### vs. Make, Just, Task

builderman is JavaScript/TypeScript-native, provides structured results, handles cancellation and teardown automatically, and supports readiness detection for long-running processes.
